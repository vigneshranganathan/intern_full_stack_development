A Django-based interactive Q&amp;A chatbot platform for Electrical Machines using MySQL and a ChatGPT-compatible API (like Groq).
=======
Intern Full Stack Development Test: Electrical Machines Q&A Platform

Project Overview:

You are tasked with building a web application using Django and MySQL to create a platform for users to ask questions related to electrical machines.
The application should pull relevant data from a ChatGPT plugin to provide accurate answers to user queries.

Requirements:

1. Backend Development:
   * Implement a Django web application with the following features:
    * User registration and authentication system.
     * Ability for authenticated users to ask questions related to electrical machines.
     * Store questions and answers in a MySQL database.
     * Integration with a ChatGPT plugin to pull relevant data for answering questions on electrical machines.

2. Frontend Development:
   * Create a user-friendly interface for asking questions and displaying answers.
   * Ensure responsiveness and usability across different devices.

3. ChatGPT Integration:
   * Utilize the ChatGPT plugin to query for relevant answers based on user questions related to electrical machines.
   * Display the retrieved answers along with the questions in the user interface.

4. Database Design:
   * Design a MySQL database schema to store user information, questions, and answers related to electrical machines.

5. Ubuntu OS Deployment:
   * Deploy the application on an Ubuntu server.
   * Ensure proper setup and configuration for smooth functioning of the application.

Instructions:

* Number of users : 10, Number of fields/columns for database: 5, Number of data/rows: 10
* Fork this GitHub repository: [Intern Full Stack Development Test](https://github.com/vigneshranganathan/intern_full_stack_development/)
* Complete the tasks described above within 3 days.
* Ensure your code is well*documented and follows PEP 8 standards.
* Use Django for backend development and MySQL as the database backend.
* Integrate the ChatGPT plugin to pull relevant data for answering questions on electrical machines.
* Deploy the application on an Ubuntu server (you can use any cloud provider or local setup).
* Once completed, submit your solution by sending a pull request to the main repository.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Functionality: Does the web application meet the specified requirements? Are users able to register, ask questions related to electrical machines, and view relevant answers?

2. Code Quality: Is the code well*structured, readable, and maintainable? Are best practices followed?

3. Integration with ChatGPT Plugin: Is the ChatGPT plugin integrated effectively to provide relevant answers? Are queries sent to the plugin appropriately and responses handled correctly?

4. Database Design: Is the database schema well*designed and appropriate for the task? Are relationships between entities defined correctly?

5. Frontend Design: Is the user interface intuitive and user*friendly? Does it provide a smooth experience for asking questions and viewing answers?

6. Ubuntu OS Deployment: Is the application successfully deployed on an Ubuntu server? Is it accessible and functional?

7. Documentation: Is the code adequately documented? Are setup instructions provided for deployment on an Ubuntu server?

Note: If you encounter any issues or have questions during the test, feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance.
